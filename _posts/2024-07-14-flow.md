## Flow

- User requests proof generation task from the On-chain protocol through an SDK
- User listens for a specific event from the Orchestrator network, fetching the server URL of the assigned prover
- User requests ZKP from prover
- Prover generates ZKP and in parallel:
  - submits task result to the Orchestrator network
  - returns the ZKP back to the User
- User listens for an event from the Orchestrator network for the task completion, validates its received proof and data against those on-chain.
  - In case of mismatch or liveness fault, triggers a slashing method.
