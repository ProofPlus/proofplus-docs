## What is ProofPlus?
ProofPlus is a permissionless, decentralized prover market protocol that utilizes a ticketing mechanism to democratize proof generation tasks.

ProofPlus aims to revolutionize the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) landscape by enabling both enterprise-grade and small-scale provers to participate and earn revenue. The protocol ensures inclusivity and fairness through its innovative ticketing system, which balances the playing field based on self-reported proof generation capabilities.

**Permissionless:** ProofPlus allows everyone to participate in the proof market, providing equal opportunities for all participants to earn revenue, regardless of their scale.

**Community-aligned:** ProofPlus is built with the support of its community and is fully open-source. This means anyone can use, modify, and contribute to the ProofPlus source code under a permissive license. The project encourages community engagement in reviewing, auditing, testing, and improving the protocol, fostering a collaborative and transparent ecosystem.
